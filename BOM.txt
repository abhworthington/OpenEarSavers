The earsavers use 5 total parts: 2 "forks", 2 "locks", and a piece of elastic.

Production of the first 4 parts is generally done with rapid prototyping (FDM, SLA), but other methods are possible. PLA is plenty strong for this.

The parts are designed for 9.5mm/0.375in wide elastic webbing approximately 1mm (0.04in) thick. Webbing that does not narrow when stretched is preferred, but is not necessary. If you need some suggestions:
- Dritz 9531W
- Dritz 9531B
